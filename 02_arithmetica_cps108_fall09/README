Impressions:
	I definitely wasn't expecting this assignment to take as long as it did, or I would have started it earlier.
	It was very enjoyable though, especially at the end when you have your own working calculator. I was glad that
	you gave us extra time to finish the project, as it allowed me to implement some of the extra credit and fixed
	some bugs that I found.
